## Current Performance Issue
Describe the current performance bottleneck or slow operation.

## Metrics
### Current Performance
- Response time: [e.g., 5 seconds]
- Throughput: [e.g., 10 requests/sec]
- Resource usage: [e.g., 80% CPU, 2GB memory]
- ETL duration: [e.g., 30 minutes]

### Target Performance
- Response time: [e.g., < 2 seconds]
- Throughput: [e.g., 50 requests/sec]
- Resource usage: [e.g., < 50% CPU, < 1GB memory]
- ETL duration: [e.g., < 10 minutes]

## Proposed Solution
Describe the optimization approach:
- [ ] Query optimization
- [ ] Indexing improvement
- [ ] Caching strategy
- [ ] Code refactoring
- [ ] Infrastructure scaling
- [ ] Parallel processing
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## Implementation Details
Technical details of the proposed optimization.

## Testing Strategy
How will you measure the improvement?
- [ ] Benchmark tests
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Profiling analysis
- [ ] A/B comparison

## Risks
What are the potential risks or trade-offs?

## Priority
- [ ] Critical (System unusable)
- [ ] High (Major impact on UX)
- [ ] Medium (Noticeable improvement)
- [ ] Low (Minor optimization)
